1.) Factory - 
	we used the design abstract factory in the models. We created an interface called ViewTemplate.java and CLIView.java implements it.

2.) Builder - 
	we used the builder design model in the models directory. We build a complex UMLModel.java by using simple objects. 
	
3.) MVC
	we used the MVC design model. Our models are in the models directory, the view files are in the views directory, and the controller
	files are in the controller directory. 
	
4.) Memento
	we used memento by creating a model memento for the undo and redo functions.
	
5.) Composite
	we used this in UMLModel since it brings together all of our models into one.
	
6.) Command
	we used this in our tab completion. We created different commands which activated based on what was typed in the command line.
	
7.) Mediator
	we used this in Main since it calls the controllers that handle data going through the views and models.
	
8.) State
	we used this in undo and redo since the "this" is based off of which state the object is in.

9.) Facade
	we used this in the views and controllers. We created simple interfaces which are defined in a more complex class.
